# DSA_BASICS (SoC)

This repository is a collection of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey during the Summer of Code (SoC) period. I've focused on mastering the fundamentals of C++ and problem-solving through hands-on practice on platforms like LeetCode and TakuForward.

## Topics Covered So Far

### C++ Basics
- Input / Output
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions and Scope
- Arrays (1D and 2D)
- Vectors and STL Basics
- Strings and String Manipulation
- Bit Manipulation
- Recursion (Basic to Intermediate)
- Linked List (Singly, operations, basic implementations)
- Binary Search (on arrays, rotated arrays, etc.)

## Practice Platforms
- LeetCode – Solved beginner to intermediate level problems across all topics.
- TakuForward – Followed topic-wise curated sheets and problem sets.

## Plan of Action (Upcoming Topics)

I will continue to strengthen my DSA foundations by exploring the following advanced topics:

- Stack and Queues (including Monotonic Stack/Queue)
- Sliding Window and Two Pointer Techniques
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, Tree Traversals, etc.)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Cycle Detection, Topological Sort, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation, Pattern Recognition)
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Tries and HashMaps
- Backtracking
- Segment Trees and Binary Indexed Trees (Fenwick Trees)

Each of these topics will be covered with:
- Concept Notes
- Problem Solving Practice
- Code Implementations with Comments

## Challenges Faced

- Recursion: Initially struggled with understanding the flow of recursive calls, base cases, and stack behavior. Dry-running helped a lot.
- Bit Manipulation: Bitwise operations were confusing at first. Repeated practice with pattern-based problems made the logic clearer.
- Linked List Implementation: Keeping track of pointers and avoiding null reference errors required attention to detail and debugging.

## Learning Outcome

This project helped me build confidence in using C++ for DSA. I have developed a structured approach toward solving problems, improved my debugging skills, and learned how to write clean and efficient code. Consistent daily practice has played a major role in this progress.

## What's Next?

I plan to continue this journey by:

1. Completing remaining core DSA topics:
   - Stack, Queue, Deque
   - Trees and Binary Trees
   - Graphs and related algorithms
   - Dynamic Programming and Greedy Techniques
2. Revising already learned topics regularly.
3. Solving mixed-topic problems on LeetCode and TakuForward.
4. Starting participation in weekly contests and mock interviews.
5. Documenting learnings and common patterns in each topic folder.
6. Building 1-2 mini projects using DSA concepts for real-life use cases.
7. Preparing for placement/internship level coding rounds by solving 150–200 quality problems.
